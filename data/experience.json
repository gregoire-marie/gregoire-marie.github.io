    "description": "Satellite maneuver detection using ML heuristics. Designed and validated deep neural networks for orbital state prediction, unsupervised anomaly detection, and correction of numerical propagators. Processed sparse and noisy datasets (radar, laser), fused heterogeneous data sources (solar activity, ballistic coefficients), and applied deep clustering and computer vision for maneuver characterization."
